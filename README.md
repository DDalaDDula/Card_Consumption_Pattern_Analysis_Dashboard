#### Usually, The Web Chart is implemented in FrontEnd and The Chart source is provided at the BackEnd.
#### From the developer's point of view, behavior such as DB connection, Data preprocessing, and Modeling must be developed from BackEnd with Python and Web chart visualization should have been developed from FrontEnd with Javascript(e.g. chart.js). But Plotly & Dash can be visualized based on the web only with Python, without having to use two languages. So, the results of Data analysis or Modeling implemented in Python can be viewed as they are.
