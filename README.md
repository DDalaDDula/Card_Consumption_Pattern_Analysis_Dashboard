##### Usually, The Web Chart is implemented in FrontEnd and The Web Chart is provided at the BackEnd.
##### From the developer's point of view, behavior such as DB connection, Data preprocessing, and AI should have been developed from BackEnd with Python, and Web visualization should have been developed from FrontEnd with Javascript(e.g. chart.js). But Plotly & Dash can be visualized based on the web only with Python, without having to use two languages. So, the results of AI or Data analysis implemented in Python can be viewed as they are.
